Description: It has functions to implement the copula mixed model for meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies and produce SROC curves and summary operating points (a pair of average sensitivity and specificity) with a confidence region and a predictive region. See details for the methodology in Nikoloulopoulos, A.K. (2015) A mixed effect model for bivariate meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies using  a copula representation of the random effects distribution, ArXiv e-prints.
